A. General Rules

  01) All staff members are to be respected at all times. They volunteer their time to police the server, and they do
  not get paid for it, so please show them respect.

  02) Griefing is defined as breaking or building on anything that does not belong to you that was created by another
  player. Any instance of grief will not be tolerated.

  03) Use of hacked clients such as Nodus is not acceptable. Other mods such as X-Ray mods (ore-finder) are also not
  allowed. The mods allowed are as follows:
    * TooManyItems/NotEnoughItems
    * Rei's Minimap (or other similar minimaps)
    * RoyalSkins
  Furthermore, if a mod not listed as safe for use in the rules would like to be used, permission should be acquired
  prior to use.

  04) The use of ender pearls to teleport inside of //locked// houses or other protected areas is **strictly**
  prohibited.

  05) Be courteous and respectful to the other players of the server. The server is shared, and a negative environment
  does not help anyone.

  06) Offensive buildings/structures are prohibited. These are not respectful to all players. Examples of offensive
  builds include, but are not limited to:
    * Swastikas
    * The World Trade Center filled with TNT
    * Genitalia
    * Vulgar words
    * Inappropriate symbols

  07) Only one account is permitted per user/IP. If multiple people live in the same household (and share the same IP),
  this must be expressed to staff members before an application is accepted.

  08) The only way to obtain a Civilian status is by having an application accepted at apply.royaldev.org.

  09) Raiding, spawn-killing, stealing, looting, griefing, or other focused, intentional, harm-causing activities are
  prohibited. See PvP rules for information about PvP.

  10) Attacks on the server (hardware related) are not permitted. All IPs associated in an attack will be blacklisted,
  and the respective ISPs of said IP addresses will be alerted. Legal discourse may be taken if the offense is serious
  enough.

  11) Staff members are not required to assist players in building or other game activities. Staff members //are//
  required to investigate claims of grief or other rule-breaking activities.

  12) Using privileges not available to other players for other players is prohibited. Examples of such actions include
    * Spawning items for players without spawning privileges
    * Teleporting players to inaccessible areas
  Furthermore, using privileges not available to other players against other players is prohibited. Staff are not bound
  by this rule.

  13) Advertising any product or server is strictly prohibited.

  14) Staff members have the final say on any rule-based decision.

  15) The minimum age for play is 13. The recommended age is 18. Players under 13 years of age will be banned.

  16) Ranks and donation perks may be taken away at any time for any reason. Donating does not exempt a player from
  bans. Donations will not be refunded, nor will any compensation be given for losing access to the server after
  donating.

B. PvP Rules (Player vs Player)

  01) PvP that is unwarranted is not allowed. Any PvP where either side of the fight has not accepted a duel is
  prohibited. PvP where both sides have agreed to a fight is permitted. Examples of warranted PvP:
    * A player is inside of private property owned by the attacker
  Examples of unwarranted PvP:
    * Accepting a teleport request and killing the person that was teleported
    * Running around and killing people at random
    * Killing people for being near private property
    * Killing people for fun  

  02) Self-defense is allowed. If any unwarranted PvP occurs, the recipient may retaliate and kill the attacker.

  03) Items won in PvP (self-defense included) may be kept by the killer.

  04) The safest way for PvP to be approached is by setting up a match. If both players agree to the match, then both
  sides are protected by the PvP rules. This is valid PvP.

  05) If PvP is reported, the responding staff member will decide if the PvP was warranted.

C. Faction Rules

  01) Land may not be stolen from other factions unless both factions are set as enemies.

  02) Bribes, blackmail, or threats are not acceptable methods of faction recruiting. Use of such methods is strictly
  prohibited.

  03) New factions may not be created bordering another faction.

  04) Rules written down in a faction by a staff member of that faction are considered server rules for members of that
  faction. Not following such rules may result in punishments equivalent to breaking a server rule.

  05) Leaders kicked out of their faction for inactivity will not be reset to leader when they return. It is up to the
  leader to make sure that he remains active.

  06) Faction rules may not supersede server rules.

  07) PvP rules in claimed faction land are defined by the leader of the faction that has claimed the land.

  08) Land may not be claimed for the sole purpose of using faction-defined PvP rules. For example, spotting someone in
  the wilderness and claiming the land they are in to kill them is not allowed.

D. Chat Rules

  will not be curbed in any manner. If this is unacceptable, do not use the server.

  02) Excessive verbal abuse is not allowed. Arguments should be taken into private messages. No one likes being caught
  in a quarrel.

  03) Sexual harassment will not be tolerated. Sexually themed messages, buildings, etc. will not be accepted. Any
  sexual abuse/harassment should be reported to staff or posted on the forums immediately.

  04) Asking for ranks in chat is prohibited.
