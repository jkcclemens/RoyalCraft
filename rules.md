# RoyalCraft Factions Rules
Revision 1

## Preamble
Not following any of these rules is grounds for a permanent ban. It is up to the individual staff member handling a breach in these rules to decide the correct punishment. Punishments may be less severe than a permanent ban. Respect the decisions made by the staff.

If any part of the rules are vague or up to interpretation, it will be the staff member's interpretation that is used in deciding punishments.

Finally, feel free to suggest rules or to make pull requests to revise these rules. Ensure that if you make a pull request to update the revision number.
